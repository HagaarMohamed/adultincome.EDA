# Adult Income Dataset: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

This repository contains an exploratory data analysis (EDA) of the **Adult Income** dataset. The goal of this project is to explore the dataset, visualize relationships, and provide insights that can help in understanding the features and their impact on the prediction of income level.

## Dataset Description

The **Adult Income** dataset is used for predicting whether a person makes over $50K a year based on census data. The dataset contains both categorical and numerical features that describe various demographic factors.


### Objective:

The primary goal of this project is to perform an exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the **Adult Income** dataset to understand the relationships between features and the target variable, which indicates whether an individual's income exceeds $50K/year.

- `pandas`
- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`
